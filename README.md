libsodium-openwrt
=================

A simple [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org) package for the [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) library.
This package makes libsodium avaialbe to other programs during the build progress (for static linking).
The code is released under Public Domain.

### Package notes

This package does only build libsodium as part of the build environment.
That means that libsodium will be only included when linked as static
library by some other program during the image build process.

That is why we have no release libsodium packages here.
But that would be possible when the script would be changed
to create a dynamic library.

Static linking makes sense when not all parts of libsodium are used since
OpenWrt is used for embedded devices (mostly WLAN-routers).
When libsodium is linked by multiple programs then those parts
are compressed by the filesystem to take up space only once.

### How to build a OpenWrt image

These commands show how to build an OpenWrt image including libsodium
<pre>

cd openwrt

./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a

git clone https://github.com/mwarning/libsodium-openwrt.git
cp -r /libsodium-openwrt/libsodium package/
rm -rf libsodium-openwrt

make defconfig
make menuconfig
#select target hardware and libs => libsodium
make
</pre>
